Optimizations in 'index.html'
-----------------------------

1) Reference print media query/stylesheet only on print
2) Execute google analytics js asynchronously
3) Reduce profilepic.gif image size
4) Reduce pizzeria.jpg image size
5) Remove link to fonts.googleapis since 'Open Sans' appears to be already available to the browser

Optimizations in 'main.js'
--------------------------

1) Simply function determineDx by removing extraneous calculations
2) Move 'document.querySelectorAll' out of loop in function 'changePizzaSizes' so that this method isn't called with every loop iteration
3) Define 'document.body.scrollTop' as a variable  so that it doesn't need to be calculated with each loop iteration
4) Reduced number of pizzes rendered from 200 to 32 to ensure that enough pizzas are rendered to display 4 complete rows of 8 pizzas.
